# Prompt History Record: Global Constitution Creation

## Prompt Summary

User requested creation of a single global constitution for "Evolution of Todo" project covering Phase I through Phase V, defining:
1. Spec-Driven Development as mandatory
2. Agent Behavior Rules
3. Phase Governance
4. Technology Constraints
5. Quality Principles

## Response Summary

Created comprehensive constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with:

### Key Sections Created:
1. **Spec-Driven Development Mandate** - Golden rule: No code without approved specs
2. **Agent Behavior Rules** - Constraints on AI/automated agents
3. **Phase Governance** - Strict phase isolation (I-V)
4. **Technology Constraints** - Approved stack per phase
5. **Quality Principles** - Clean architecture, stateless services, cloud-native
6. **Development Workflow** - Feature development sequence
7. **Amendment Process** - How to change the constitution
8. **Compliance Checklist** - Verification before merge

### Phase Technology Matrix:
| Phase | Key Tech |
|-------|----------|
| I | Python CLI, In-memory |
| II | Python, JSON/SQLite |
| III | FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon DB |
| IV | Next.js, Docker |
| V | OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP, Kafka, Dapr, K8s |

### Version Info:
- Version: 1.0.0
- Ratification Date: 2024-12-27

## Files Created/Modified:
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (NEW - canonical location)
- `constitution.md` (UPDATED - redirect to canonical)
- `history/prompts/constitution/PHR-001-global-constitution-creation.md` (NEW)

## Lessons Learned:
- Constitution should be phase-agnostic at principle level
- Technology constraints should be phase-specific
- Spec-driven development enforces discipline across all phases
